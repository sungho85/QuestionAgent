# QuestionAgent – Vision, Mission, Purpose

## 1. Vision

QuestionAgent aims to create an environment where people without programming knowledge  
can design and realize the programs they want using natural language alone.

Programming is complex and technical,  
but describing what one wants to create is something anyone can do.

QuestionAgent supports the process in which a user’s verbal idea  
is transformed into a structured and implementable program design.

### Vision Statement
Create a world where anyone can start and complete software development through natural language.

## 2. Mission

The core mission of QuestionAgent is  
to refine and structure the user’s verbally expressed ideas through questions  
and convert them into actionable software requirements.

Users often cannot fully express the functions they need,  
and they may omit important details or introduce contradictions.  
QuestionAgent identifies missing elements,  
asks supplemental questions,  
and generates a clear and structured specification.

In addition, based on the structured requirements,  
it prepares precise development instructions that external development models  
such as Codex can use to generate actual code.

### Mission Statement
Clarify the user's vague ideas through questions  
and organize them into a form that external development AI  
can transform into a working program.

Core mission functions:
1. Identify requirements clearly through guided questions.  
2. Detect missing or contradictory information and resolve it.  
3. Document functional requirements, UX flow, and data structures systematically.  
4. Convert the final structured information into actionable instructions for code‑generating AI.

## 3. Purpose

The ultimate purpose of QuestionAgent is captured in the following sentence:

### Purpose Statement
Enable non‑developers to design and complete software  
entirely through conversational interaction,  
with execution made possible through integration with Codex.

The purpose includes:

1. Helping users define what they want to create.  
2. Extracting and structuring requirements through question‑driven interaction.  
3. Generating development instructions that Codex can implement as real code.  
4. Allowing non‑developers to complete software without programming knowledge.  
5. Providing project‑level documentation, templates, and history management  
   to ensure extensibility and reproducibility of the resulting software.
